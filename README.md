Sudoku.zip is a program written in java to play Sudoku inspired by a project for university. It was modified and simplified to avoid plagiarism. 

conference_scraper allows to go through a csv file containing pages from website (ex: https://dblp.org/db/conf/atal/aamas2017.html, https://dblp.org/db/conf/atal/aamas2018.html, https://dblp.org/db/conf/aistats/aistats2015.html, https://dblp.org/db/conf/aistats/aistats2016.html etc). For each of those pages, the first scraper will scrape the names of the authors for each publications and save the names in a csv file. The second scraper scrapes the title of each of those publications and saved this information in a different .csv file for each year.
Verify that all the library are installed before running the code!
