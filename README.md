Sudoku.zip is a program written in java to play Sudoku inspired by a project for university. It was modified and simplified to avoid plagiarism. The first step will ask you to enter the localisation of the file, you have to enter it as "c:/MyDocuments/somefile.csv". This file should contain the line, the colonne, and the value for each case that will be already filled in the Sudoku game like this: "014 056 135".

conference_scraper allows to go through a csv file containing pages from website (ex: https://dblp.org/db/conf/atal/aamas2017.html, https://dblp.org/db/conf/atal/aamas2018.html, https://dblp.org/db/conf/aistats/aistats2015.html, https://dblp.org/db/conf/aistats/aistats2016.html etc). For each of those pages, the first scraper will scrape the names of the authors for each publications and save the names in a csv file. The second scraper scrapes the title of each of those publications and saved this information in a different .csv file for each year.
Verify that all the library are installed before running the code!
